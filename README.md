# TronGame
This game is the arcade version of a light cycle battle from the movie Tron.
I chose this game because this movie is one of my favorite movies of all time.
How the game works is there are two players; each with their own sets of controls.
Player One will have the blue light cycle and be mapped with left, right, down, and up arrow keys and 
Player Two will have the red light cycle (for lack of orange color) and will have a, s, d, w as their controls.
As the cycles go, they leave behind a trail which causes the player to crash if they run into it.
The goal is the elimate the opponent by boxing them in with your light trail.
